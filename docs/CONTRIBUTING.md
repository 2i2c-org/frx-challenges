## Build the documentation locally

To build the documentation:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/2i2c-org/unnamed-thingity-thing
   ```

1. Navigate to the docs folder:

   ```bash
   cd docs/
   ```

1. Install the software packages for documentation:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

1. Start a MyST server to preview the documentation:

   ```bash
   myst start
   ```

This will build the documentation locally so that you can preview what your changes will look like.
